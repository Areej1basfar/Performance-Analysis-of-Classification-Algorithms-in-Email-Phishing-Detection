Performance Analysis of Classification Algorithms in Email Phishing Detection<br><br>
üß† Project Overview<br>
This project presents a comparative analysis of multiple machine learning classification algorithms to detect phishing emails. The dataset includes engineered features such as word counts, links, and urgency indicators to help identify malicious messages.

‚öôÔ∏è Algorithms Used<br>
-Random Forest
<br>
-K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
<br>
-Decision Tree
<br>
-Logistic Regression
<br>
-Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
<br>
-Support Vector Machine (SVM)
<br>
-Naive Bayes (Categorical)

üìä Results<br>
Each model's accuracy and classification report were evaluated using balanced training data and standardized test features. The best performance was achieved by ANN and SVM, with accuracies exceeding 98%.
